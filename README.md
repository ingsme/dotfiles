# my dotfiles

These are my current dotfiles. I use [dots](https://github.com/EvanPurkhiser/dots) to manage my dotfiles.

## usage
1. clone repo
2. source repo/init
3. dots groups set base ++
4. dots install

### install
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ingsme/dotfiles
source dotfiles/init
dots groups set base [other groups]
dots install
```

## thanks
- I forked [Anders Vaage's](https://github/com/eckhart) dotfiles as a starting point for my repo. 

Apart from those allready mentioned I guess I should thank every other person whose dotfiles I have perused in search for inspiration and good ideas. I should of course have kept a log, but this I have not done. Anyway, if you see some idea or consept that may have originated from you: Thank you!
